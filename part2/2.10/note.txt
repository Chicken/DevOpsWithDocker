I kinda accidently did this already so I had to revert and redo what I did on the earlier exercises.
Anyway these ports are getting confusing to maintain when this machine is already running way too many services (including apache reserving 80/443).
So please forgive me if I submit wrong ports with the docker-compose files...

But so, remove the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL env var from frontend and change the REQUEST_ORIGIN in backend to be without a port.
