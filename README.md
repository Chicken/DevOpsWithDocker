# DevOps with Docker

Repository for [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/) exercises.

## Side notes
- Some docker outputs such as `docker ps` and `docker images` have been manually modified to exclude containers and images not part of this course.
- Skipped kubernetes
  - Didn't come here to learn that
  - Drawing oh god
- I disliked the heroku exercises. Did them anyway.
- Why must so many exercises use the example-backend and example-frontend.
  - Pain to manage
  - Pain to build
  - Pain to keep track of ports
- Should have mentioned before 3.4 that you were supposed to use ubuntu baseimage instead of node & golang images
