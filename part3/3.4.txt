At start:
- frontend: 1.17GB
- backend: 1.06GB

How do you get these images to be under 500MB...
In the backend there is nothing to combine
and removing stuff makes no difference as they are in the baseimage layers.
The frontend was able to be combined a little and remove node dependencies and such
but it's still nowhere near your ideal scores.

Oh I see, you expected me to manually install node and go on ubuntu baseimage
instead of using the dedicated baseimages...
Welp that sucks as the first exercise to introduce these said nothing about that...

After optimizations:
- frontend: 987MB (hey atleast a little...)
- backend: 1.06GB (no change...)
